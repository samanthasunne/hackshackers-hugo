Thank you for contributing to the Hacks/Hackers website! If you are adding or updating information for your group, you have come to the right place. Please contact Hacks/Hackers with any questions.

## Group Name, Location, Site and Organizers

Each group has a YAML file with the group's name, location, URL and organizers, that we use to generate the map on the homepage. If you are updating any of these things, please find the correct file in the [/data/groups/ folder](/data/groups/).

Here is an [annotated example][4] of what the file should look like.

You can request changes to it by making a Pull Request. To do this, you will need a free Github account. Click the pencil icon on the YAML file, which will prompt "Fork this project and edit this file." Then make your changes and click Create Pull Request. This will send it to the Hacks/Hackers team, who will need to approve the changes before they appear on the site.

To add a new group, you will need to create a YAML file. In the [/data/groups/ folder](/data/groups/), click Add File > Create New File, and enter all the information in the example above. Click Commit New File at the bottom, which will send your page to the team for approval.

# Group Landing Pages

If your group is hosted on a site like Facebook or Meetup, the YAML file should include a link to that site. To update your group's URL, see the section above.

You can also use HacksHackers.com to host a landing page for your group. These are separate from the YAML files and are located in the [/groups/ folder](/groups/). To update your group's landing page, please find the correct file in the [/groups/ directory](/groups/).

Here is an [annotated example](/groups/example-group.md) of what the page should look like.

You can request changes by making a Pull Request. To do this, you will need a free Github account. Click the pencil icon on your group page, which will prompt "Fork this project and edit this file." Then make your changes and click Create Pull Request. This will send it to the Hacks/Hackers team, who will need to approve the changes before they appear on the site.

To add a new group to the website, create a new Markdown File, using the [Example Group](/groups/example-group.md) as a template. Submit this page as a Pull Request, which will send it to the team for approval.

# Images

To embed an image from somewhere else on the web, copy and paste this code into your page, with no spaces:

![Alternative text describing the image here] (https://example.com/url-of-your-image-here)

To upload your own image, click Upload a New File in the [group-images folder](/content-images/group-images/). Then copy the link to your file and use it in the code above.

When you're done, you'll need to create a pull request for your changes to go live. See above for how to file a pull request.
